## What is this app?
This Android app is our group project for the MOBI3002 class.
The main goal of this app is to create a functioning Pokédex, retrieving data from the API available at [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon). This app is planned to include:
 - A scrollable list including every Pokémon included in the API, displaying basic information such as names, types, dex numbers, and images of the Pokémon
 - Individual pages for each Pokémon, displaying more in-depth information such as:
	 - Stats
	 - Moves
	 - Abilities
	 - Weight & height
 - Evolution trees viewable as dynamic charts (if a chart cannot be used for this, a screen will take its place)
 - The ability to favourite Pokémon and view all of the Pokémon you've favourited
 - The ability to search specific Pokémon
